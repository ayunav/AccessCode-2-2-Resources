# Resources Readme
# 
An attempt to make all the resources mentioned in iOS class and Slack
sticky. Resources used in class or during the interview process have no
attribution (since we are all already familiar with them), while
resources mentioned by classmates, professors and TA's in conversations
outside the context of class are followed by the name of the person who
mentioned the resource (if it is known).


## Guidelines
## 
Contributors are encouraged to recommend things they have actually used
in their learning process in order to keep the list useful and keep it
from degenerating into something that could easily be substituted by
Google searches. Feel free to include short comments about why you found
a resource particularly useful to your learning process. This will give
us a window into how each other learns and may have an impact on future
C4Q cohorts.

Cheers and keep on coding!
